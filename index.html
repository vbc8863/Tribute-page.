            <p class="font"><i>|I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very younge and idealistic industry. There weren't many degress offered in computer science,so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money... There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not what they're about."</i>
